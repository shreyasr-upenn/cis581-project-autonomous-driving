#### Install Car Simulator
Install Udacity Car Simulator - https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim (We installed Version 1)

#### Run the model
Download the driving_sim.zip file from the google drive folder and unzip it.

Navigate into the driving_sim folder, should observe drive.py and model.pth files along with other files.

Create python virtual environment in this this directory and install all the dependencies
OR
Install dependencies to the global python interpreter.

Then while you are in the driving_sim directory, run the following command on CMD prompt/Terminal:
(might have to activate the python environment if a python virtual environment was created)

python drive.py model.pth


Start up the Udacity simulator. Choose the scene on the left and press the Autonomous Mode button.

Should observe the vehicle drive autonomously.
